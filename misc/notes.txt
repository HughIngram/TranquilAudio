TODO move this file into a misc directory

Current commit:
    >Feature: Play from a choice of different files from the list

    >BUGS to fix in this commit:
    -Play a (non-default) scene
    -close the service
    -press play from the bottom bar
    -the wrong scene is played

    >NOTES:

====================
BEFORE RELEASE v1:

>handle audio focus

>loop the tracks.

>Implement a dark colour scheme
    -extend from Theme.AppCompat
    -alternate colours subtly
    -consider contrast radio. How can I measure this?

>Tweak look of listview as per MD

>Feature: improve notification controls
    -appears only after hitting resume
    -has a pause / resume button
    -has a close button
    -lock screen control
    -Add more metadata to notification - info about current track, album art?
        use the MediaStyle metadata fields
    -change lifecycle / behaviour - the notification should not show if:
        >the context is in foreground and nothing is playing
        >user presses 'x' button on notification
        >user leaves context with nothing playing
    -when the track changes, it will be necessary to publish the update.

>Integrate Iconography assets
====================

AFTER v1:
>Add images
        add image resources

>figure out how to handle stopping playback completely
    -remove the notification
    -should there be a stop button anywhere?


>implement http download service
    -investigate the Repository pattern

>sleep timer
    -fade out nicely as an option


>is the AudioPlayerService configured to run in a different process from the activities?
    -it should be a private remote service.

>find a better way to keep track of State (PlayerStatus, PlayingTrack...)
    -SharedPrefs?

>BUG: The play button in the mcb does not have a shadow.
====================
====================

DONE:

get the MediaPlayer service to keep playing 
-rotate events
-go to different activities
-lock the screen

Change Mail icon to resume

>BUG: rotating causes the list to be duplicated
>BUG: first click on resume does not start audio
>make a checkstyle rule set
>change package name
>alternate resume button

>BUG: leaving the app with audio playing, then resuming, will show the wrong
        status in resume button.

>add ripple to bottom bar button

>the media bar is included in animations between activities, but as far as the
    user is concerned, it is always the same media bar. Is there a way to prevent
    it from animating?
        -use a fragment?
https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Shared-Element-Activity-Transition

>ensure the AudioPlayerService is decoupled from the location of media

>change checkstyle rules to not require comments on setters, getters, constructors
    -load files from the SD card
    -directory of JSON files containing:
        >path to audio file
        >title of track
        >etc
    -in future this can directory can be the cache; an http service can put files there.
    -move file storage to the internal part of the SD card, remove read / write permission
    -if I want to have the audio files in internal storage, they will need to be downloaded
    over REST - to have an app which can be deployed with no back-end, I'll need to switch
    back to using the /raw folder
            >commit the changes so far before reverting them, for the sake of reference.
            >or just comment out the bit that reads from the file system

    -put JSON in raw folder, as if it were a downloaded file.
    -how am I going to store the audio location (in raw folder) as JSON??
    -what will the behaviour of the resume button be? What if a track is already playing,
    then the user views the page for another track?
        >the playing track fragment should show a pause/resume button
        >other tracks should show a resume button to switch over to that one
        >SceneDetailFragment should behave similarly - or rather SceneListActivity
        should change its behaviour depending on isTwoPane and the active list element

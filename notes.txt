Current commit:
    >Feature: Play from a choice of different files from the list
    -explicitly sort the list of Scenes

    >Done:
    -implement other play button
    -add audio resources
    -implement loading of audio from different locations

    >BUGS to fix in this commit:
    - rotating SceneDetailActivity loses the title

    >NOTES:
    -load files from the SD card
    -directory of JSON files containing:
        >path to audio file
        >title of track
        >etc
    -in future this can directory can be the cache; an http service can put files there.
    -move file storage to the internal part of the SD card, remove read / write permission
    -if I want to have the audio files in internal storage, they will need to be downloaded
    over REST - to have an app which can be deployed with no back-end, I'll need to switch
    back to using the /raw folder
            >commit the changes so far before reverting them, for the sake of reference.
            >or just comment out the bit that reads from the file system

    -put JSON in raw folder, as if it were a downloaded file.
    -how am I going to store the audio location (in raw folder) as JSON??
    -what will the behaviour of the play button be? What if a track is already playing,
    then the user views the page for another track?
        >the playing track fragment should show a pause/play button
        >other tracks should show a play button to switch over to that one
        >SceneDetailFragment should behave similarly - or rather SceneListActivity
        should change its behaviour depending on isTwoPane and the active list element

====================
>add ripple to bottom bar button

>ensure the AudioPlayerService is decoupled from the location of media

>change checkstyle rules to not require comments on setters, getters, constructors

>handle audio focus

>Add images
        add image resources

>figure out how to handle stopping playback completely
    -remove the notification
    -should there be a stop button anywhere?

>Feature: improve notification controls
    -appears only after hitting play
    -has a pause / play button
    -has a close button
    -lock screen control
    -Add more metadata to notification - info about current track, album art?
        use the MediaStyle metadata fields
    -change lifecycle / behaviour - the notification should not show if:
        >the context is in foreground and nothing is playing
        >user presses 'x' button on notification
        >user leaves context with nothing playing
    -when the track changes, it will be necessary to publish the update.

>implement http download service
    -investigate the Repository pattern

>sleep timer

>loop the tracks. Start each one at a random point in the recording.
====================
====================

        status in play button.
